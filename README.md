Zenponsive 
==========
A simple responsive CSS framework (with Zenphoto gallery themes in mind)
----------------------------
Yet another framework ;-) 
---------------------------
Why you may ask. Admittedly this is not that different from lots of other grid frameworks and does not exactly re-invent the wheel. It is of course inspired by frameworks like [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and surely it is a bit less sophisticated than those.

It was made for my own use (and education) to provide a plain simple and flexible grid without the predefined design bells and whistles other frameworks like Boostrap often ship.
