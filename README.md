Zenponsive 
==========
A simple responsive CSS framework (with Zenphoto gallery themes in mind)
----------------------------
Yet another framework ;-) 
---------------------------
Admittedly this is not that different from lots of other grid frameworks like bootstrap and of course is inspired by them. Why reinvent the wheel? 

Probably it is a bit less sophisticated than those. But I was made for my own use (and education) to provide a simple and flexible grid without all the bells and whistles others have to leave more freedom.

The features:
-------------

1. Fluid scaling percent based 12 column layout with predefined widths 960/1280/1600/fullwidth. 

2. Base version (without gutter): You can easily combine or nest columns around without needing to care about different left, middle or right margins for the first or last column in a row. You just set any margin/padding using your elements within the column using an custom css file. 

3. Gutter extension additionally: 4% default gutter to be loaded an extra css file. There is also no first/last item to care about.

3. No predefined styles and typography: All styling up to you. Only a normalize css to reset browser differences is included optionally.

4. Only three default mediaquery breakpoints on 980/767/479 since the framework is fully fluid. You can easily extend if you need or want more via your custom css file.

5. Extra column classes: By default all columns becomme full width (col12) on the smallest 479 breakpoint. But there are extra ones for some columns to force a different behaviour.

Browser support
----------------
Generally tested with latest browser versions of:
- Safari
- Firefox
- Opera
- Chrome
- IE7+ (responsiveness not directly tested).

Because of the percentage roundings are different in all browsers it may not always be 100% accurat (works best in Firefox and Chrome which perform subpixel rounding)
